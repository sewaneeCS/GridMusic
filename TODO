TODO

 - The random number generator used for this is not
   weighted, and it would be interesting to experiment with
   a guassian distribution, and maybe something like perlin noise

- There is a slight bug in the duration calculation
   it occurs when a single grid point is selected after a long duration
   note. It is very repeatable, and hopefully won't be too much of a 
   bear to track down.

 - The gui is still a little unwieldy and the code is gross.
   that clean up is a first priority

 - The controls for modifying the probablities used for the 
   expansion have not yet been added to the gui, and that is another
   first priority issue that is basic to the functionality of the tool

 - The class organization used here is questionable, and should not be
   taken as canon for any further versions. Matrix is not what I'm looking for
   The basic organization of the Scale/Sequence will not change.
   You may be asking why I bothered with a Note class if the Sequence handles
   pitches and durations as separate arrays. That redundancy will probably persist
   for a little while longer, as in several cases it is easier to manage the two
   seqarately.
